## [shopsys/framework]

### Application
- call `Form::isSubmitted()` before `Form::isValid()` ([#1041](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/1041))
    - search for `$form->isValid() && $form->isSubmitted()` and fix the order of calls (in `shopsys/project-base` the wrong order could have been found in `src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Controller/Front/PersonalDataController.php`):
        ```diff
        - if ($form->isValid() && $form->isSubmitted()) {
        + if ($form->isSubmitted() && $form->isValid()) {
        ```
- fix the typo in Twig template `@ShopsysShop/Front/Content/Category/panel.html.twig` ([#1043](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/1043))
    - `categoriyWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildren` ⟶ `categoryWithLazyLoadedVisibleChildren`
- follow instructions in [the separate article](upgrade-instructions-for-read-model-for-product-lists.md) to introduce read model for frontend product lists into your project ([#1018](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/1018))
    - we recommend to read [Introduction to Read Model](/docs/model/introduction-to-read-model.md) article

### Tools
- we recommend upgrading PHPStan to level 4 [#1040](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/1040)
    - you'll find detailed instructions in separate article [Upgrade Instructions for Upgrading PHPStan to Level 4](/docs/upgrade/phpstan-level-4.md)
