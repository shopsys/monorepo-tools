# Shopsys Project-base

This repository is part of Shopsys Framework - a **scalable ecommerce framework** for fast-growing ecommerce sites created and maintained by in-house developers or outsourcing agencies.

Shopsys/project-base repository contains the fully ready base for building your Shopsys Framework projects. This repository is READ-ONLY and it is maintained by monorepo [shopsys/shopsys](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys).

For more informations about project, please see [shopsys/shopsys](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys) readme.

## Installation
We recommend to choose **installation via Docker** because it is the easiest and fastest way to start using Shopsys Framework.
Docker contains complete development environment necessary for running your application.
In the future we want to add new technologies to Shopsys Framework (e.g. ElasticSearch).
**Updating your development environment to use these technologies will be very easy with Docker**
because such an update will be done just by running `docker-compose build`.
And that is all!

Create new project on Shopsys Framework easily from this package following one of the installation guides:

* [Installation via Docker (recommended)](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/docs/installation/installation-using-docker.md)
* [Native installation](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/master/docs/installation/native-installation.md)
