### Download
First, you download the package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require shopsys/product-feed-zbozi
```

### Register
For the bundle to be loaded in your application you need to register it in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:
```php
// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Shopsys\ProductFeed\ZboziBundle\ShopsysProductFeedZboziBundle(),
            // ...
        ];
        
        // ...

        return $bundles;
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

## How to use
You should see the new feed immediately after installation in the administration feed list.
All output XML files will be automatically generated by a cron module or they can be generated manually in administration when logged as superadmin.
